# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE_DATA

In collaboration with UNP, I worked on a Power BI project analyzing Brazilian e-commerce data using seven datasets. I started by cleaning and transforming the data in Power Query, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency across datasets. Then, I established relationships between tables and created calculated columns and measures using DAX for deeper analysis. The project involved designing four interactive dashboard pages with KPIs, charts, and slicers to provide a comprehensive view of customer behavior, sales trends, payment methods, and seller performance. I analyzed key aspects such as regional sales distribution, delivery efficiency, and customer purchasing patterns. The dashboards highlighted crucial insights, including top-selling products, preferred payment options, and seller performance metrics. I also identified trends affecting customer satisfaction and business growth. By leveraging Power BIâ€™s advanced visualization tools, I created an intuitive and data-driven storytelling experience. This project strengthened my skills in data modeling, DAX, and business intelligence. It also improved my ability to extract actionable insights that drive strategic decision-making. Working on this project provided valuable hands-on experience with real-world e-commerce data. It deepened my understanding of how data analytics can optimize business operations. Overall, this project was a significant learning experience that enhanced my analytical and problem-solving abilities.
